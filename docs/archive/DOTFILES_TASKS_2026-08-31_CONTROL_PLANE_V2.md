# Archived task contracts — control-plane v2

Moved out of `TASKS.md` on 2026-09-01 to stay inside the hot-context budget.
Completed and superseded only; the live queue keeps the recent entries.

### TASK-026: Check the command manifest in both directions
- **Requirement:** REQ-DELIVERY-CONTRACT-GAPS
- **Risk Level:** R1
- **Allowed Paths:** `config/ai/runtime-commands.txt`, `bin/ai-policy-lint`, `bin/ai-policy-lint-test`, `TASKS.md`
- **Protected Paths:** None
- **Canonical Contract Owners:** `runtime.command-manifest`
- **Accepted Invariants:** every extensionless executable in `bin/` is listed, and every listed entry exists
- **Regression Checks:** `ai-policy-lint`, `installer-link-test`
- **Runtime Evidence:** removing an entry fails the lint by name
- **Reopen Conditions:** a `bin/` command exists that no installer links
- **Non-Scope:** helper scripts carrying a suffix, which are sourced rather than linked
- **Verification:** `bin/ai-policy-lint`
- **Escalation Conditions:** the extensionless convention stops distinguishing commands from helpers

`installer-link-test` proved every manifest entry resolves to an executable.
Nothing proved the reverse, so a command could live in `bin/` and never reach
`~/.local/bin` on any device — invisible on the machine that wrote it, absent
everywhere else. TASK-022 fixed four such commands and still missed
`omp-runtime-report`, because its own check compared `bin/*-test` against the
manifest's `-test` entries; a non-test command was outside the question it asked.

Found while setting the Mac up, by the symlink that did not appear.

### TASK-021: Make the parallel-child example executable, not proofread
- **Requirement:** REQ-DELIVERY-CONTRACT-GAPS
- **Risk Level:** R1
- **Allowed Paths:** `docs/task-change-boundary.md`, `bin/delivery-ledger-test`, `TASKS.md`
- **Protected Paths:** None
- **Canonical Contract Owners:** `delivery.parallel-child-contract`
- **Accepted Invariants:** the published `start-child` block runs against the shipped binary
- **Regression Checks:** `delivery-ledger-test`
- **Runtime Evidence:** the test extracts the block from the document and executes it
- **Reopen Conditions:** the document publishes a `start-child` block the test cannot run
- **Non-Scope:** `integrate-child`, which needs a patch the document does not carry
- **Verification:** `bash bin/delivery-ledger-test`
- **Escalation Conditions:** the example cannot be run without inventing state the document omits

TASK-020's routing-provenance guard broke the block eleven days ago and nothing
noticed: it omitted `--model/--provider/--reasoning-effort`, argparse defaulted
them to `unknown`, and the guard refused the run. Fixed, and now extracted from
the document and executed by `delivery-ledger-test` — proofreading is what let it
rot. The pending entry expected `--accept-dirty`; it was not needed, because the
file was clean by the time this ran.

Writing the test surfaced a second thing the document only implies: producing the
child's patch before `start-child` makes the child's boundary overlap the parent's
dirty tree, which the ledger correctly refuses. The order is now stated.

### TASK-025: Executed evidence for delivery checks
- **Requirement:** REQ-EXECUTABLE-EVIDENCE
- **Risk Level:** R2
- **Allowed Paths:** `bin/delivery-ledger`, `bin/delivery-ledger-test`, `docs/task-change-boundary.md`, `TASKS.md`
- **Protected Paths:** None
- **Canonical Contract Owners:** `delivery.verification-event`
- **Accepted Invariants:** a recorded status is either derived from an exit code or explicitly declared, never both
- **Regression Checks:** `delivery-ledger-test`, `ai-policy-lint`
- **Runtime Evidence:** this run's own verification events carry `executed.exitCode`
- **Reopen Conditions:** a PASS is recorded for a check that has an exit code but was not run
- **Non-Scope:** child-run recording, browser evidence
- **Verification:** `bash bin/delivery-ledger-test`
- **Escalation Conditions:** the flag cannot derive a status without shelling out unsafely

`record --command` runs the check and derives the status from its exit code;
`--status` alongside it is refused, because an agent that may both run a check and
name its result can skip the first half. Motivated by this repository accepting
`installer-link-test PASS` detailed "pending run below" earlier the same day —
recorded before the check ran, by the session building these gates.

The first attempt at this run was finished `BLOCKED`: the new flag was exercised
inside the live run, and a deliberate `exit 3` probe recorded a real FAIL that
correctly barred `PASS`. The ledger behaved exactly as designed; the run did not.
