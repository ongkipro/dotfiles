# Turnstile Spin skill

Turns the prompt "set up Turnstile" into a working end-to-end integration: a widget, a deployed managed siteverify Worker, frontend snippets at every chosen insertion point, and a real validation pass before reporting success.

You are the agent. Run the wizard below by invoking the scripts under `scripts/` and branching on their JSON output. The scripts hold the deterministic logic (API calls, retry/error handling); your job is orchestration, codebase reading, confirmation, and the frontend edits.

Canonical instructions live at [`developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin/). If the docs page and this file disagree, trust the docs page.

## When to load this skill

Load when the user's prompt mentions any of:

- "Turnstile", "CAPTCHA", "bot protection"
- "siteverify", "cf-turnstile-response"
- "protect this form", "stop bot signups", "spam signups"
- A specific signup, login, or contact form combined with "Cloudflare" or "bot"

Do not load for unrelated Cloudflare tasks (Workers, Pages, R2, etc.) unless Turnstile is also mentioned.

## Conversation flow

The user pasted the prompt. You are in a multi-step dialog. Detect what you can, ask only when you have to, confirm before every irreversible step. Each numbered moment is one agent message. Items marked **[wait for user]** require a user response.

1. **Brief acknowledge.** One sentence: "I'll run Turnstile setup end to end. That's: check auth, scan the codebase, create the widget, deploy the Worker, wire the frontend, validate. Proceed?" **[wait for user]** Do NOT present a plan yet. Auth + scan come first.

2. **Wrangler check.** `npx wrangler --version`. If missing, ask once: "Install wrangler with `npm install --save-dev wrangler` (Node project) or `npm install -g wrangler` (other)? Proceed?" **[wait for user]** If install is blocked entirely (corporate policy, blocked npm), fall back to driving Steps 4-5 via `curl` against `api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/`.

3. **Auth + scope probe (FIRST irreversible action).** Run `scripts/auth-probe.sh`. Branch on `status`:
   - `ok`: continue to Step 4. The script already picked the account (single-account token, or one matching `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).
   - `missing_token`, `missing_scope`, or `missing_workers_scope`: ask the user to create a token at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens → Custom token → permissions `Account.Turnstile:Edit` **and** `Account.Workers Scripts:Edit` → include the target account in Account Resources. **Do NOT direct them to `wrangler login`**. Its OAuth scope doesn't include `Account.Turnstile:Edit` or `Account.Workers Scripts:Edit`. The token must never enter chat or tool input. Ask the user to export `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in their own terminal and relaunch the agent from that environment.
     The user must configure the environment outside the agent session. When auth is established after relaunch, re-run `auth-probe.sh`, then continue to Step 8.
   - `multiple_accounts`: the token covers more than one account and `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is unset. Present the numbered `accounts` list. **[wait for user]** Then export `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<chosen>` and re-run `auth-probe.sh`.
   - `account_mismatch`: `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is set but isn't one of the token's accounts. Show the `accounts` list and ask the user to either `unset CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` or set it to one of those IDs.

4. **Account selection.** If `auth-probe.sh` returned `ok` after a `multiple_accounts` round-trip, this is already done. Otherwise the script picked the single account silently and you continue to Step 5.

5. **Domain.** Always include `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. For production, scan `package.json` `homepage`, `wrangler.toml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, git remote. Confirm: "I'll register for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `<domain>`. OK?" **[wait for user]** If no production domain is found, ask.

6. **Codebase scan.** Detect framework + insertion candidates silently.

7. **Insertion plan.** Show the candidate list with `[recommended]` / `[skip by default]` markers; ask the user to confirm (numbers, "all", "recommended", or a list). **[wait for user]** If an existing CAPTCHA was detected, present a migration plan instead (see "Migrating from another CAPTCHA").

8. **Widget creation.** Run `scripts/widget-create.sh --account-id <id> --name <name> --domains <list> --mode managed`. Report only the public sitekey. The script deliberately discards the secret from its output.

9. **Worker deploy.** Run `scripts/worker-deploy.sh --name turnstile-siteverify-<project-slug>` and report the Worker URL. Pause and ask the user to retrieve the widget secret from Cloudflare and run `npx wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY --name <returned worker_name>` in their own terminal. Never request, read, or pass that value through chat, environment inspection, or agent tool input. Continue only after the user confirms the local command succeeded.

10. **Frontend edits.** State the contract: "I'll add the widget + gate the existing submit handler on `success === true`. The existing handler logic stays the same." Ask "yes" / "show". **[wait for user]** If "show", print unified diffs and ask again. Do NOT propose alternate behavior (mail delivery, custom backends).

11. **Validation.** Run `scripts/validate.sh`. Report each check as it passes. If any fails, surface the error and stop. **[wait for user if anything fails]**

12. **Persist skill.** Ask: "Save the Spin skill to `.claude/skills/turnstile-spin/SKILL.md` so I can reuse it on follow-up tasks?" Default yes. **[wait for user]** Then run `scripts/persist-skill.sh --path <agent-specific-path>`.

13. **Final report.** Print the structured summary: what was created, what was validated, what to do next.

### Things you must NOT do

- Do not request, read, print, or write the Turnstile secret. The user configures it through Wrangler's local prompt.
- Do not skip validation.
- Do not overwrite files without showing a diff.
- Do not deploy a Worker to a different account than the widget was created in.
- Do not call siteverify from the browser. Always: browser → user's Worker → siteverify.
- Do not use `sudo` or install global packages without asking.

### Hard scope boundary: DO NOT ask the user about

Spin validates the Turnstile token via a managed Worker before the user's existing form handler runs. Everything else is out of scope:

- **Email / SMS / notification delivery.** Leave the existing submit handler alone (just gate it on `success === true`). Don't propose Resend, Mailchannels, SMTP, mailto.
- **Custom Worker code.** Deploy the stock Worker template bundled at `templates/worker/`. Don't write a new Worker. Don't add features (rate limiting, custom routing, third-party integrations).
- **Database / payment / OAuth / form persistence.** Out of scope.
- **Frontend framework migration, refactoring, or styling.** Edit only what's needed.
- **reCAPTCHA v3 score thresholds.** Turnstile returns `success: true/false`.
- **Pre-clearance-only setups.** If `clearance_level !== no_clearance`, siteverify is optional and Spin doesn't apply. Redirect the user and exit.

### Recovery flow: respect existing widget configuration

When the user has Cloudflare dashboard access, the in-dashboard **Fix with Spin** banner is the preferred recovery path; it deploys the managed siteverify Worker server-side without requiring `wrangler` or an API token. This skill's recovery flow below is the fallback: use it when the user is driving from their editor without leaving it, or when the dashboard recovery does not apply (FedRAMP, gate-restricted account, etc.).

If the user tells you they already have a Turnstile widget set up and want to wire siteverify to it without rotating the sitekey (e.g. "I have a sitekey but siteverify never worked", "set up Spin against my existing widget `<sitekey>`"):

1. Skip Step 8 (widget creation). The sitekey already exists; get it from the user.
2. Fetch non-secret widget metadata via `scripts/fetch-secret.sh --account-id <id> --sitekey <key>`. Branch on `status`:
   - `ok`: read `clearance_level` and `domains` from the response. Confirm `domains` includes the user's production hostname; if not, surface the gap before proceeding.
   - `missing_read_scope`: tell the user to add `Account.Turnstile:Read` to the token. Do not ask for the secret in chat or tool input. If they cannot expand the token scope, ask them to configure the Worker secret themselves with `npx wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY --name turnstile-siteverify`, then confirm only the non-secret `clearance_level` and domains.
3. Check `clearance_level` from the response (or the user's answer):
   - `no_clearance`: standard recovery (deploy Worker, wire siteverify).
   - anything else: ask whether they want siteverify on top of pre-clearance, or exit per the scope boundary.
4. Continue from Step 9 (Worker deploy). Site key does not change. Dashboard's `Deployment` column flips from `Manual` to `Spin` on the first request carrying `data-action="turnstile-spin-v1"` (this skill) or `data-action="turnstile-spin-v2"` (dashboard "Set up with Spin" button).

If the user is recovering a widget that was created via the dashboard "Set up with Spin" button, a managed Worker is likely already deployed in the account. Confirm with the user whether they want a fresh Worker (proceed) or just need help wiring the frontend to the existing one (skip to Step 10 and ask for the existing Worker URL).
5. Never recreate the widget to get a fresh secret. That breaks the existing sitekey everywhere it's deployed.

### The frontend-edit contract

When wiring an existing form to the Worker (Step 10), the contract is: **gate, don't replace.** The user's existing submit handler keeps doing what it did. Spin only adds a validation step before it.

```js
form.addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const token = /* read cf-turnstile-response */;
  const result = await fetch(WORKER_URL, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ token }) });
  const data = await result.json();
  if (!data.success) return; // show failure
  // existing handler logic runs here, unchanged
});
```

If the existing handler was a stub, Spin leaves it a stub gated on success. The user can replace the stub later; that's not Spin's job.

## Migrating from another CAPTCHA

During the Step 6 codebase scan, also look for existing reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha. If found, switch Step 7 to a migration plan.

Detection signals:
- reCAPTCHA: `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js`, `class="g-recaptcha"`, `data-sitekey="6L..."`, backend POST to `/recaptcha/api/siteverify`
- hCaptcha: `https://js.hcaptcha.com/1/api.js`, `class="h-captcha"`, backend POST to `https://hcaptcha.com/siteverify`

Substitution:
- Replace script tags with `https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js` (`async defer`).
- Replace `class="g-recaptcha"` / `class="h-captcha"` divs with `class="cf-turnstile"`, update `data-sitekey` to the new Turnstile sitekey, add `data-action="turnstile-spin-v1"`.
- Token field changes from `g-recaptcha-response` to `cf-turnstile-response`.
- Backend siteverify URL points at the Spin-deployed Worker. Drop `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` / `HCAPTCHA_SECRET` env vars.

Edge cases to surface to the user:
- **reCAPTCHA v3 score thresholds.** Turnstile has no score. Tell the user explicitly that migrated code will reject on `success === false`.
- **reCAPTCHA Enterprise.** Don't auto-migrate. Point at [developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/migration/recaptcha/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/migration/recaptcha/).
- **Custom `action=` values.** Preserve any custom action the user passed to `grecaptcha.execute` as `data-action` on the widget. Use `turnstile-spin-v1` only when no custom action exists.

## Edge cases

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| `wrangler` not installed | Install path: `npm install --save-dev wrangler` (Node project) or `npm install -g wrangler` (other) |
| Multiple Cloudflare accounts | `scripts/auth-probe.sh` returns all accounts; ask the user to choose, export `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| Cloudflare Pages project | Deploy the managed Worker anyway, OR suggest the [Pages Plugin](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/plugins/turnstile/) |
| `EXPECTED_HOSTNAME` mismatch | Update widget domains via PUT, not PATCH (PATCH returns `10405 Method not allowed`): `curl -X PUT .../widgets/$SITEKEY -d '{"name":"...","mode":"managed","domains":[...]}'` |
| Worker name conflict | `worker-deploy.sh` retries automatically with a hash suffix |
| Token expired mid-flow | Stop, re-run `scripts/auth-probe.sh`, prompt for fresh credentials |
| Step 11 returns `missing-input-secret` | Ask the user to rerun `npx wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY --name <worker_name from worker-deploy.sh output>` in their own terminal, wait 10 seconds, then re-validate. Never ask for the value. |

## Telemetry marker

Every snippet this skill writes must include `data-action="turnstile-spin-v1"`. Widgets created via the dashboard "Set up with Spin" button use `data-action="turnstile-spin-v2"` instead; preserve that marker if you encounter it on an existing widget you are modifying. Both feed the same account-level aggregate telemetry, never per-user. Cloudflare uses it to measure activation. If the user removes the attribute, the integration still works; only the analytics segmentation is lost.

## Do not

- Do not request, read, print, or write the secret.
- Do not skip validation (Step 11).
- Do not propose features outside the wizard (custom Worker code, custom domains, advanced WAF rules) unless asked.
- Do not call siteverify from the browser.
- Do not deploy the Worker into a different account than the widget.
